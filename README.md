# Project3-Group4

Proposal: My Life Advisors App

Purpose: The app will have multiple characters who will display advises for users on different aspects of life. This could potentially help users to make better life decisions, have a good laugh, be motivated or inspired.

Summary: The app will utilize multiple APIs to display different feeds of advises upon the selection of users.  Upon signing up for an account the user will have the ability to click on certain quote and favorite the quote. Each characters will have a certain limit of how many times they can give advises until they need to "feed", at which point the user will have to click on the feed option in order to continuing getting advises from the characters. Users will also have the ability to tweet their favorite quotes as well as deleting certain favorite quotes if they choose to do so. The characters could also have random interactions with each other such as giving certain compliments or humor comments to certain quotes of the other characters when they're not selected for advises.
